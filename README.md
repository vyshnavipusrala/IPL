# Cricket Match Outcome Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of a cricket match and simulate its progression based on match statistics. The model provides real-time predictions on whether the batting team will win or lose, and how the match will unfold over time.

## Project Aim

The primary aim of this project is to predict the outcome of a cricket match based on various match statistics such as runs left, balls left, wickets, and team information. This prediction can be used to analyze the dynamics of the match, make informed decisions, and increase fan engagement by providing real-time insights into match progression.

## Importance of the Project

- **Predicts Match Outcomes**: It provides real-time predictions about which team is likely to win.
- **Analyzes Match Dynamics**: The model analyzes how key match statistics influence the outcome.
- **Enhances Fan Engagement**: Fans can interact with the model to receive live predictions during a match.
- **Improves Strategic Decisions**: Teams can use predictions to adapt their strategies based on match progression.

## Features

- Real-time match outcome prediction.
- Simulated match progression with dynamic predictions.
- Provides insights into the current match situation, including run rate, wickets, and runs left.
- Simple user interface to interact with the model.
- Logistic Regression model used for classification.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- pickle (for saving the trained model)
- Jupyter Notebook (for code development and testing)
